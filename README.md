_This was a very fun express-hbs project. The hbs templates are in the views folder_
_See app.js and db folder for node.js usage_

_In order to run this app you need a file called `.env` in the project root with the required DB and AWS credentials_

   1. change directory: `cd cs467`

   2. install dependencies: `npm install`

   3. run the app: `npm start`
